The programming language landscape is about to welcome a fresh and culturally grounded addition:  
**Soplang**, a Somali-first programming language, is preparing to launch its long-awaited 2.0 release. Designed
with native Somali syntax, dual typing, and full developer tooling, Soplang 2.0 is shaping up to be more than just a
language — it’s an ecosystem.

### What’s Soplang?

Soplang is a programming language built around Somali linguistic conventions. The core idea is to make programming more
intuitive for native Somali speakers by using Somali keywords like `door` (variable declaration), `haddii` (if), and
`howl` (function). But it’s not just syntax sugar — Soplang introduces modern features like static typing, object-oriented
programming, error handling, and even a module system.

### Soplang 2.0: What’s New?

The upcoming 2.0 release represents a complete overhaul from the early interpreter version, introducing a wide array of
improvements across language features, libraries, and tooling:

#### Language Features

- **Dual Typing System:** Support for both static and dynamic variable declarations
- **Class Support:** Object-oriented programming with inheritance using `fasalka` and `ka_dhaxal`
- **Robust Control Flow:** Including conditionals, `while`/`for` loops, and `return`/`break`/`continue` statements
- **Structured Error Handling:** Try-catch support via `isku_day` and `qabo`

#### Growing Standard Library

The 2.0 release significantly expands the standard library, including:

- Math functions for statistics and vector math
- File system access with readable functions like `faylka_fur` and `faylka_qor`
- Network module with HTTP request/response support
- Date and time utilities to simplify common tasks

#### Developer Tooling

One of the most impressive aspects of Soplang 2.0 is the developer experience:

- **VS Code Extension:** Syntax highlighting, inline documentation, code execution
- **REPL:** Interactive terminal with syntax coloring and history
- **Browser Runtime (`sopScript`):** Bring Soplang into web environments
- **CLI Tooling:** Includes a package manager for libraries and modules.

### What’s Next

According to the development roadmap, Soplang 2.0 is in the final phase of its Python-based interpreter. A future
Rust-based compiler is planned to boost performance and system-level applications.
