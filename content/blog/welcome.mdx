## Welcome

This is a sample blog post. Replace this content with your own markdown.

You can use standard markdown syntax:

- **Bold** and _italic_ text
- Lists and code blocks
- Links and images

## Writing Your Own Posts

Add new `.mdx` or `.md` files in the `content/blog` folder. Each file needs frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Your Post Title
description: A short description
author: Optional author name
date: 2025-02-12
---
```

Then write your content below in markdown!
